### Hi there, welcome to our project ðŸ‘‹: 
## Collect and Graph Traffic flow through public CCTV in Ho Chi Minh City. ðŸ“¸ðŸ“¹

The idea of this project is to collect data from [public CCTV provided by the Department of Transportation in HCMC][CCTV] and analyze the statistics collected. We achieved this through a multiple processes, mainly involve utilizing *Yolov5 AI* vision and Python *tkinter* interface. Detailed report about our project is linked [here][report]. ðŸ“–ðŸ“–ðŸ“–

## How to use

To check out our project, install the  [Github][github] of this project and run the ***main.py***. It will open a window as shown here:<br />
![Traffic App](/traffic/app.png "Traffic App")<br /> When the *Graph* button is clicked, the app will draw a chart of the traffic at the selected location and date with a mini analysis of the data beside.<br/>ðŸ“…

If you wish to see the realtime data, you need to collect it first. To do it, run the ***trafficCapture.py*** file in the folder *module* (remember to change your saved location). After collected the data you want, you need to detect it using ***detect.py*** with the following command in the terminal (assumming you store the at data/images/folder):
```
python detect.py --source data/images/folder
```
The final step is to copy that detected file (*.txt* format, stored in runs/detect/exp...) into the *traffic* folder. Hurray, now you can see the result in **Traffic App**. Opening the app by simply running ***main.py***.
